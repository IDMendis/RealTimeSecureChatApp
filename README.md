# 💬 Real-Time Secure Chat Application

A Java-based real-time chat system that demonstrates key **network programming concepts** such as TCP sockets, multithreading, NIO (Non-blocking I/O), and secure communication with AES encryption and SSL/TLS.  

---

##  Project Overview

The **Real-Time Secure Chat Application** enables multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages securely.  
It supports both **group chats** and **private chats**, along with features such as **message encryption**, **multi-threaded handling**, and **client-server communication** using Java Sockets.
